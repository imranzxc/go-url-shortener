3. Build the executable:

   ```bash
   go build
   ```

4. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./url-shortener
   ```

## Configuration

The application can be configured using environment variables or a configuration file. Here are the available configuration options:

- `ENV`: Environment mode (`local`, `dev`, `prod`). Default is `prod`.
- `STORAGE_PATH`: Path to the SQLite database file.
- `ADDRESS`: Address to listen on (e.g., `:8080`).
- `HTTP_SERVER_TIMEOUT`: Timeout for read and write operations.
- `HTTP_SERVER_IDLE_TIMEOUT`: Timeout for idle connections.
- `HTTP_SERVER_USER`: Username for basic authentication.
- `HTTP_SERVER_PASSWORD`: Password for basic authentication.

Example configuration file (config.yaml):

```yaml
env: prod
storage_path: "data/url_shortener.db"
address: ":8080"
http_server_timeout: "10s"
http_server_idle_timeout: "120s"
http_server_user: "username"
http_server_password: "password"
```

## Usage

### Creating Short URLs

Send a POST request to `/url` with the original URL in the request body:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/url -u username:password -d '{"url": "https://example.com/very/long/url"}'
```

### Redirecting Short URLs

```bash

```
